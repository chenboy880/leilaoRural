# Leilao Rural

A school project, based in a system B2C, developed to be an auction system to sell animals.
Once just in Portuguese, now, in english too.

There are two types of users: Admins and customers.

To log in with an Admin account, use:
Email: admin@admin.com
Password: admin

To log in with a customer account, use:
Email: buyer@buyer.com
Password: buyer

OR

Sign up in the system, there is a link in the index page.

To use the system, you can find the Database configuration in the file "../Classes/bd.class.php".

Feel free to contact me if you have any question.
